// This file summarizes all employee user interactions in the app, based on code analysis as of June 2025.

/**
 * Employee User Interactions Overview
 *
 * 1. Authentication:
 *    - Employees log in via EmployeeAuth (src/pages/employee/EmployeeAuth.tsx)
 *    - Login handled by useApp context, with feedback via toast notifications
 *
 * 2. Dashboard & Requests:
 *    - EmployeeDashboard (src/pages/employee/EmployeeDashboard.tsx) is the main hub
 *    - Employees see a list of service requests (ServiceRequestList)
 *    - Can select a request to view details (RequestDetailsDialog)
 *    - Can accept (handleAccept) or decline (handleDeclineClick/handleDeclineSubmit) requests
 *    - Accepting sends a price quote to the user, triggers a toast, and updates request status
 *    - Declining requires a reason (min 50 chars), updates status, and notifies user
 *    - Employees can adjust price quotes (EmployeePriceAdjustDialog)
 *    - Employee location is shown on a map (EmployeeLocationDialog, GoogleMap)
 *
 * 3. Settings & Profile:
 *    - Accessed via EmployeeSettingsMenu (tabs: Account, History, About)
 *    - Account tab: view/change avatar, see username/email, logout
 *    - History tab: view completed requests, with user and time info
 *    - About tab: app info
 *    - Avatar changes are previewed (demo only, not persisted)
 *    - Logout available from multiple places (header, settings)
 *
 * 4. Simulation & Assignment:
 *    - useEmployeeSimulation hook loads/simulates available employees
 *    - Employees are assigned to requests (randomly or by exclusion)
 *    - Decline count tracked per employee/request (ServiceRequestLogic, EmployeeInteractionComponent)
 *    - If declined twice, a new employee is assigned
 *    - Employee movement toward user is simulated (ServiceRequestLogic)
 *
 * 5. Admin Management:
 *    - Admins can view, create, and edit employee accounts (EmployeeManagement)
 *    - Employee status (active/inactive/suspended) can be updated
 *    - Employee data includes username, email, phone, role, status, created date
 *
 * 6. Database/Backend:
 *    - Employee accounts stored in employee_accounts table
 *    - Employee actions (accept/decline/complete) reflected in employee_finished_requests, user_history, etc.
 *    - Migration utilities exist for employee data
 *
 * 7. UI Feedback:
 *    - All major actions (login, accept, decline, logout, avatar change) trigger toast notifications
 *    - Errors are handled and shown to the user
 *
 * 8. Miscellaneous:
 *    - Employees can switch language and theme
 *    - Employee info (name, phone) shown to users after acceptance
 *    - Employee interactions are demo/simulated in some flows
 *
 * For more details, see:
 *   - src/pages/employee/EmployeeDashboard.tsx

 *   - src/hooks/useEmployeeSimulation.ts
 *   - src/services/employeeAccountService.ts

/**
 * Simulated Employees & User Interactions
 *
 * Simulated Employees:
 *   - Employees are loaded from the employee_simulation table (see useEmployeeSimulation.ts)
 *   - Each simulated employee has: id, employee_number, full_name, created_at
 *   - Names are sourced from public/lovable-uploads/employee-simulation-names.txt
 *   - Used for demo/testing flows and random assignment in simulations
 *
 * Simulated User Interactions:
 *   - Employees are assigned to requests randomly (excluding declined employees)
 *   - Employee actions (accept/decline) are simulated with delays and randomization
 *   - Decline count is tracked; after 2 declines, a new employee is assigned
 *   - Employee movement toward user is simulated on the map
 *   - Price quotes are generated with random variation for each request
 *   - All major actions (assignment, quote, decline, completion) trigger toast notifications
 *   - These flows are used in demo mode and for onboarding/testing
